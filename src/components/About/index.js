      <h2>About Sean</h2>
      <p>
        I have been part of the internet since the early days of dialup and AOL.
        Over the years, I have watched it continuously evolve and eventually
        become a daily part of almost everyone's life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a software engineer, I have fully immersed myself in this world.
        It allows me to work with groups of like-minded people as a team.
        Working with a team is great because it will enable you to collaborate
        and take your project beyond just your imagination.
      </p>

        As a developer, I can offer a wide range of services. I look forward to
        getting started on your project.
